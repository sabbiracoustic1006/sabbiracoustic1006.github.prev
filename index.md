## Welcome to My Page

I have completed my B.Sc. from the Department of EEE, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, in April 2019. Currently, I am working as a Machine Larning Engineer at [REVE Systems](https://www.revesoft.com/), Bangladesh. I am working in REVE Systems for almost a year now. Before joining REVE Systems, I was with the Digital Signal Processing Research Laboratory at the Department of EEE, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

I have done several projects, competitions and researches related to Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Biomedical Image Processing, Deep Learning, Audio Processing and Natural Language Processing. 

### Undergraduate Projects

My Passion for application based Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Image Processing research and development started from my third year of B.Sc. Education. In my fourth year, in Control Systems I Laboratory, I did a group project for generating images of crime suspects from facial attributes and plotting using CNC plotter. The idea was to do the job of a sketch artist in a forensic department. We used generative model to generate image from facial attributes and after processing the image the image was to be plotted in a 2D paper using CNC plotter. We designed and trained the generative model using [Celeb-A dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and built the CNC Plotter ourself with a limited budget.
